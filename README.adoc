= Spring Cloud Data Flow Acceptance Tests =

This project bootstraps a dataflow server on a target platform, executes a series of tests by creating a series of streams and tasks and then cleans up after its done.

== How to run it

The main script is called `run.sh` and supports a few flags:

```
USAGE: run.sh -p <PLATFORM> -b <BINDER> [-s -t -c]
  The default mode will setup, run tests and clean up, you can control which stage you want to
  have executed by toggling the flags (-s, -t, -c)

Flags:

[*] -p  | --platform - define the target platform to run
    -b  | --binder - define the binder (i.e. rabbit, kafka) defaults to rabbit
    -tests - comma separated list of tests to run. Wildcards such as *http* are allowed. (e.g. --tests TickTockTests#tickTockTests)
    -s  | --skipSetup - skip setup phase
    -t  | --skipTests - skip test phase
    -c  | --skipCleanup - skip the clean up phase
    -d  | --doNotDownload - skip the downloading of the server
    -m  | --skipperMode - specify if skipper mode should be enabled
    -cc | --skipCloudConfig - skip Cloud Config server tests for CF
    -sv | --skipperVersion - set the skipper version to test (e.g. 1.0.4.BUILD-SNAPSHOT)
    -dv | --dataflowVersion - set the dataflow version to test (e.g. 1.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT)
    -av | --appsVersion - set the stream app version to test (e.g. Celsius.SR2). Apps should be accessible via maven repo or docker hub.
    -tv | --tasksVersion - set the task app version to test (e.g. Clark.RELEASE). Tasks should be accessible via maven repo or docker hub.

[*] = Required arguments
```

The first option is to choose a *PLATFORM*, available options `cloudfoundry`, `local` and `k8s` (kubernetes).  The scripts for each platform are located in folders of the same name in the main directory.

By default the script will execute three main phases:

* Setup: The setup phase will traverse each folder and call `create.sh` scripts.  At the end of this phase you should expect to have an environment available with the Spring Cloud Data Flow server along with the services required for it to run.
* Test: The test phase will invoke the `mvn test` and deploy apps into the environment and run tests.
* Clean: The clean up phase will undeploy the server and remove any services.

Each phase can be toggled by setting the appropriate flag (-s, -t, -c)

The services created in the setup phase are `mysql` and `redis`.  Depending on the binder selected, it will create a Rabbit or Kafka service.

== Examples

To run the tests locally cleaning up services using Rabbit (the default binder)

`./run.sh -p local`

To run the tests locally cleaning up services using Kafka

`./run.sh -p local -b kafka`

To run the tests locally and keep the Data Flow Server, Kafka, and other services running afterwards

`./run.sh -p local -b kafka -c`


To run the tests on cloudfoundry, cleaning up services and using Rabbit (the default binder)

`./run.sh -p cloudfoundry`

To setup a Data Flow Server and services on CloudFoundry, but not run tests

`./run.sh -p cloudfoundry -c -t`


= General configuration

Make sure you have `JAVA_HOME` configured correctly in your environment. 

Each platform will have a file named `env.properties` located on `init/env.properties`, change those to reflect your
environment. Each platform has different flags, but the global ones should be:

* RETRIES : Number of times to test for a port when checking a service status (6 by default)
* WAIT_TIME: How long to wait for another port test (5s by default)
* SPRING_CLOUD_DATAFLOW_SERVER_DOWNLOAD_URL: Location of the dataflow jar file to be downloaded.

= Required environment variables when skipping setup

If you want to point to an already running Data Flow server, set the environment variables

* SERVER_URI - default is http://localhost:9393
* STREAM_REGISTRATION_RESOURCE - default is  maven + rabbit based apps
* TASK_REGISTRATION_RESOURCE - default is maven + rabbit based tasks

To point to where your server is located and also specify which artifacts you want to register with the server.

= Platform specific notes

== Local

=== Pre-requisites

* `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.  Make sure you can connect to the docker daemon without using 'sudo', e.g. `docker info` works.

* `$DOCKER_SERVER` environment variable properly set.  Defaults to localhost, which works on unix.  For MacOS `192.168.99.100` should work.

The local deployment will always try to connect to a service running on your local machine. So if you have
a local redis we will use it.

If a local service is not found, the script will try to deploy using `docker-compose` so it's important that
you have that installed and configured properly.

When cleaning up, the script will only remove docker images, if you are using a local service like redis or mysql
the script will not do anything to it

== Cloudfoundry

=== Pre-requisites
On Cloudfoundry, make sure you have the following environment variables exported. We will not include them on any files
to prevent it to be leaked into github repos with credentials.

* SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_URL
* SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN
* SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME
* SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD

=== Configuration

You can override service names and plans by either exporting or changing the following properties:

* MYSQL_SERVICE_NAME
* MYSQL_PLAN_NAME
* RABBIT_SERVICE_NAME
* RABBIT_PLAN_NAME
* REDIS_SERVICE_NAME
* REDIS_PLAN_NAME

== Kubernetes

=== Pre-requisites

_Google Cloud SDK_ installed with the `kubectl` component enabled.

=== Configuration

For Kubernetes, make sure you have the following environment variables exported.

* GCLOUD_PROJECT
* GCLOUD_COMPUTE_ZONE
* GCLOUD_CONTAINER_CLUSTER

NOTE: You can also set a KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE environment variable that specifies an existing namespace to use for the testing. If this is not specified the 'default' namespace will be used.

If you use a service account make sure to set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to point to your service account key file and to use the following to authenticate:

```
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```

=== Code formatting guidelines

* The directory `/etc/eclipse` has two files for use with code formatting, `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` for the majority of the code formatting rules and `eclipse.importorder` to order the import statements.

* In eclipse you import these files by navigating `Windows -> Preferences` and then the menu items `Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter` and `Preferences > Java > Code Style > Organize Imports` respectfully.

* In `IntelliJ`, install the plugin `Eclipse Code Formatter`.
You can find it by searching the "Browse Repositories" under the plugin option within `IntelliJ` (Once installed you will need to reboot Intellij for it to take effect).
Then navigate to `Intellij IDEA > Preferences` and select the Eclipse Code Formatter.
Select the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file for the field `Eclipse Java Formatter config file` and the file `eclipse.importorder` for the field `Import order`.
Enable the `Eclipse code formatter` by clicking `Use the Eclipse code formatter` then click the *OK* button.

** NOTE: If you configure the `Eclipse Code Formatter` from `File > Other Settings > Default Settings` it will set this policy across all of your Intellij projects.
