= Configure MiniKube for Local testing of Spring Cloud Dataflow

== Building and loading containers.
For local development you need control of the containers used in the local environment.

In order to ensure to manage the specific versions of data flow and skipper containers you can set SKIPPER_VERSION and DATAFLOW_VERSION environmental variable and then invoke `./src/local/pull-dataflow.sh` and `./src/local/pull-skipper.sh`

If you want to use a locally built application you can invoke
`./src/loca/build-skipper-image.sh` or `./src/local/build-dataflow.sh`

== Scripts

== Create Configure k8s environment

Configure and start minikube or kind for Spring Cloud Dataflow.

You can change the type of driver used by setting `K8S_DRIVER` to one of `kind, tmc, kvm2, docker, vmware, virtualbox, podman, vmwarefusion`, the default is `kind`.

=== TMC Cluster in Cloud

When using TMC Cluster configure `TMC_CLUSTER` environmental variable with cluster name:

[source,shell]
....
export TMC_CLUSTER=<cluster name>
source ./src/local/tmc/set-cluster.sh
....

=== Local Cluster

When using a local kind or minikube cluster:

[source,shell]
....
./src/local/configure-k8s.sh
....

For kind follow instruction to update `src/local/k8s/metallb-configmap.yaml`
For minikube launch a new shell and execute `minikube tunnel`

=== Deploy Spring Cloud Data Flow.

[source,shell]
....
./src/local/launch-scdf.sh
....

=== Delete the deployment from the cluster.

[source,shell]
....
./src/local/k8s/delete-scdf.sh
....

=== Delete the cluster

[source,shell]
....
./src/local/destroy-k8s.sh
....
